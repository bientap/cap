About
-----

This is the Documentation for the |SDK| version |version|.

The |SDK| provides the necessary components for partners and companies to
implement their own player application for Android. This document
specifically describes the capabilities of the |SDK| on the Android mobile
platform. 

CastLabs has developed and maintains a Java Android library called the
|SDK|, which is distributed in the form of a AAR (Android Archive
file). The SDK is based internally in Google's open source
ExoPlayer and provides extra functionality in form of plugins.

The main features of the SDK and the plugins bundled with the SDK are:

 * Playback of MPEG-DASH, SmoothStreaming, HLS, and MP4 content.
 
 * Playback of streaming and local content.
 
 * Playback of DRM protected content using Widevine, PlayReady, or OMA.
 
 * Live, event, and video-on-demand support.
 
 * Extended subtitles support.
 
 * Background playback using a Service. 
 
 * Secondary screen handling.
 
 * Offline license key storage.
