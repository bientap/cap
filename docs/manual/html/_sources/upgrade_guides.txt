Changes in 4.2
--------------

The transition from version 4.1 to version 4.2 of the |SDK| involves some breaking API changes.
We will highlight the changes here and describe the required changes that you might need to apply
in your Application to upgrade to version 4.2.

StreamingEventListener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :javaref:`StreamingEventListener` was used in version 4.1 to receive events about downloads
triggered by the player library. In order to provide more information on these callbacks, we
decided to change the method signatures slightly. Please check the API documentation for the
:javaref:`StreamingEventListener` interface and update your implementations accordingly. All
information is still present, but we are exposing the underlying `DataSpec` as well, which allows
you, for instance, to access the target URI of a given request.

Besides the changed order and the new parameter, the only parameter that was removed from the
signature was the `length`. Please use the `dataSpec.length` property instead.

AbstractStreamEventListener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :javaref:`AbstractStreamEventListener` is removed and :javaref:`AbstractStreamingEventListener` shall be used instead.

Downloader
^^^^^^^^^^

Header and query parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :javaref:`DownloadServiceBinder#getDataSourceFactory` is deprecated and  when providing the downloader
with the additional header and query parameters, the :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_HEADER_PARAMS_BUNDLE` and
:javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_QUERY_PARAMS_BUNDLE` shall be used as keys in the ``Bundle`` passed to
:javaref:`DownloadServiceBinder#prepareDownload`.

Download size
+++++++++++++

The :javaref:`Download#getTotalSize` is replaced with :javaref:`Download#getEstimatedSize`

DRM
^^^

The :javaref:`DrmTodayConfiguration.Builder#Builder` should now be created with explicitly set ``assetId``.

KeyStore
^^^^^^^^

The :javaref:`KeyStore` interface got promoted to an abstract class in 4.2. This is because some
functionality was required to be implemented at this level, and shared across all KeyStore implementations.

The main motivation for this change was to perform serialization of the stored data before and after
storing and reading the data.

In order to make transition easier we renamed the old interface methods, and expect the same behaviour
from them. These correspond to the `*internal` named methods.

In addition new methods have been added; `getAll`, `delete`, `deleteAll` and `getCount`.

KeyStore in PlayerController
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `setKeyStore` method in the :javaref:`PlayerController` has been removed. The static `DEFAULT_KEY_STORE` field
in the :javaref:`PlayerSDK` class should be used from now on.

Ads & IMA plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IMA plugin is now based on the Exo Player's ads interfaces and IMA extension. The change brings mainly
performance benefits as all the ads are now played using the same :javaref:`PlayerView` and Exo Player's instance.
The following client-facing ads interfaces have being updated as well:
 * :javaref:`AdSessionProvider` is renamed to :javaref:`AdProvider` and defines interface to create :javaref:`AdLoader`. The implementation of this interface can be used for custom-based ads provider implementations.
 * :javaref:`AdController` is removed and its APIs became part of :javaref:`AdInterface` and :javaref:`AdClientInterface` accessible via :javaref:`PlayerController`
 * :javaref:`SdkConsts.INTENT_WAIT_FOR_ADS_TO_LOAD` is deprecated and removed

SubtitlesViewComponent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :javaref:`SubtitlesViewComponent` ``getView()`` is deprecated and ``componentView()`` should be used instead.

StreamingEventListener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Format
++++++

The :javaref:`onVideoFormatChange() <FormatChangeListener#onVideoFormatChange(Format,int,long,VideoTrackQuality)>` and
:javaref:`onAudioFormatChange() <FormatChangeListener#onAudioFormatChange(Format,int,long)>` methods have been moved out
of the :javaref:`StreamingEventListener <StreamingEventListener>` interface to the new  :javaref:`FormatChangeListener <FormatChangeListener>`
interface.

If you were using any of those methods, you should implement ``FormatChangeListener``. Then you can add and remove
the listener to the :javaref:`PlayerController <PlayerController>` with the :javaref:`addFormatChangeListener() <PlayerController#addFormatChangeListener(FormatChangeListener)>` and
:javaref:`removeFormatChangeListener() <PlayerController#removeFormatChangeListener(FormatChangeListener)>` methods respectively.


onLoadError
+++++++++++

This new method will receive load error events. Note that retries will also be notified through this callback. Fatal load
errors will still by reported by the ``PlayerListener``, but now it won't receive Warning retry calls anymore.

Retries
+++++++

Now all the methods in the ``StreamingEventListener`` contain two extra params: `currentAttempt` and `maxAttempts`. You
can use these params for instance in the error callback to check for a fatal error, or to know how many retries were
required for successful loading.

Image loader
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following methods are deprecated:
 * Use :javaref:`LazyImageLoader#loadImage` instead of :javaref:`LazyImageLoader#displayImage`
 * Use :javaref:`LazyImageLoader#shutdown` instead of :javaref:`LazyImageLoader#stopThread`

Playback configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following playback configuration options are deprecated:
 * Initial video quality and keep flag: use :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_ABR_CONFIGURATION` instead of :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_INITIAL_VIDEO_QUALITY` and :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_INITIAL_VIDEO_QUALITY_KEEP
 * :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD_ID` is not used anymore
 * Language preferences: use :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_PREFERRED_AUDIO_LANGUAGE` and :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_PREFERRED_TEXT_LANGUAGE` instead of :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_PREFERRED_LANGUAGE`
 * Live edge latency: use :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_LIVE_CONFIGURATION` instead of :javaref:`SdkConsts#INTENT_LIVE_EDGE_LATENCY_MS` and :javaref:`PlayerController#setLiveConfiguration` instead of :javaref:`PlayerController#setLiveEdgeLatency`
